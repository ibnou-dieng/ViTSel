# ViTSel
Visualization Tool for Selection

ViTSel is an R-based software to visualize results of multi-environment, multi-trait analysis for selection in plant breeding. Given a matrix of genotypes by environments in rows and traits in columns, it produces several descriptive statistics and figures to explore results. It has the capability of defining different criteria to identify the best genotypes.
